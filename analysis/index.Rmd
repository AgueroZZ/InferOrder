In this project, we aim to study various ways to infer the latent ordering from the loading vectors.
The inferred ordering could be used
- to produce a smooth informative structure plot;
- to quantify the distance between two observations;
- as side information to assist in covariate-adjusted matrix factorization method.


**Analyses:**

+ [Exploring smooth-EM algorithm.](explore_smoothEM.html)
